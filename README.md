## Simple React Signup-Form (using Redux)

### `About`

Simple signup page in react. No external libraries other than Redux for the state management are used.
The form consists of multiple input fields which are validated. The input is locally stored in the client sessionStorage. Critical functions and components are tested using jest/react-testing-library. SCSS modules are used for styling.

## In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
